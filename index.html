          <p class="ps-lg-4">Hey there! My name is Harrison (Harry) Rabin. I wear a lot of hats, but my primary focus is software development and solutions. I am a student of computer science at Santa Monica College aiming to complete an A.S. degree,
            then transfer to university to complete a B.S. and beyond. I am originally from New York City, but moved to Los Angeles at a young age. I went to several schools in LA, including Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences – where I now work
            seasonally in the theater – and Venice High School. I’m very passionate about music, and when I’m not in school or writing code I dabble in music industry work, including sound engineering and assisting friends of mine in accelerating
            their music careers. I am always looking for new opportunities and interests, and take great joy in learning new things.</p>

        <p class="ps-lg-4">I have been in love with music my entire life, and in my early teens I began to have an interest in the technical side of music. I took a class about studio engineering at my school’s summer program, which kickstarted my
          passion of working with audio. I have since had the pleasure of working at various studios and events around Los Angeles, and meeting other passionate people in the industry. I’ve worked with people from all walks of life; I’ve assisted at
          a recording summer program (much like the one I was in) at a school in a disadvantaged neighborhood – a full-circle moment for me; as well as working on live events with celebrity actors and singers.</p>

        <p class="ps-lg-4">Among many sound gigs under my belt, I have had an ongoing relationship with Crossroads School since leaving as a student, working as a sound engineer during their theater production season. In my position, I have had the opportunity to work with extremely
          talented student actors and mentor student techs. Although I’m only there for a few weeks every year, I enjoy every second I get to spend working in the theater where it all started for me, and it will always have a special place in my
          heart.</p>
